AnotherWay.js allows tests written for Test.Simple framework
to use prettier run-tests.html web page for displaying results.
(see ../../doc/index.html or
http://straytree.com/TestAnotherWay/doc/index.html about it).

Just replace any use of Test.Simple, Test.Builder, Test.Harness
and Test.Harness.Browser in your tests (and index.html file)
with Test.AnotherWay, and run tests in usual JSAN way, by opening pages.

There are also additional methods available for tests, besides ok and plan:

fail( description );
eq( got, expected, description ); // deep equality
like( got, expected_regex, description );
html_eq( got_html, expected_html, description ); // html either string or node
debug_print( text ); // for tracing test execution
wait_result( seconds ); // for testing asyncronous code
delay_call( optional_delay, functions, ... ); // for testing asyncronous code
open_window( url, function( wnd ) {...} ); // for testing html pages (beware of popup blockers!)
replay_events( wnd, events ); // for replaying prerecorded mouse input

See ../../doc/doc.html or http://straytree.com/TestAnotherWay/doc/doc.html
for more details on these methods.


Examples:

See the ../../doc/jsan subdirectory.


Setup:

Copy run-tests.html into the directory with your test pages.
Copy lib/Test/AnotherWay.js into the directory where it will be found by
your tests. Replace any use of Test.Simple, Test.Builder, Test.Harness
and Test.Harness.Browser with Test.AnotherWay.


Limitations:

All test pages, index.html and run-tests.html are assumed to be
in the same directory. Otherwize, the first thing in tests and
index html must be a call to Test.AnotherWay.set_runner_location
with two arguments: relative path to the directory where run-tests.html
is located, and relative path from there to the tests directory
(see ../../doc/jsan for an example).

When opening individual test pages (not index.html),
the test code runs twice, the results of the first run are discarded.

None of Test.More functions are supported (besides ok and plan).

Browser compatibility:

Opera:

Test/AnotherWay.js does not work in versions of Opera prior to 8.0.
(run-tests.html by itself works in Opera 7.5 too).

It appears that jsan.use() does not work in Opera.
For Opera compatibility you should resort to <script> tag.

IE:

Test/AnotherWay works in IE 6.0 only. IE6 SP2 was not tested.
(run-tests.html by itself works in IE 5.5 too).

Firefox should work.

This thing was not tested in Safari/Konqueror.
