Test.AnotherWay is a single web page that uses simple convention 
for writing and running tests, has nice UI, and has handy methods
for testing web pages, testing asyncronous code, recording and
replaying mouse input, and tracing test execution.

See doc/doc.html for complete documentation with examples.

It can also run tests written for Test.Simple framework, 
and there is an adapter, lib/Test/AnotherWay.js, useful as 
drop-in replacement for Test.Builder, Test.Harness and Test.Simple.

See lib/Test/README.jsan for more information on Test.Simple compatibility.
